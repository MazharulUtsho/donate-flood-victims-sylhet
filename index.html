                        <h1>Food for a family</h1>
                        <p>Trying new and different foods over the years, from different restaurants, made me realize
                            that
                            there are many different kinds of flavors in all kinds of foods, of course some better than
                            others. When I was raised they always fed me homemade food either from my mother or from my
                            grandmother and as time went by everyone was very familiar with the different meals that
                            they
                            would cook everyday.</p>

                        <h1>Shelter for a family</h1>
                        <p>Shelter is one of the basic human needs along with food, water, and companionship. It is a
                            structure that protects you from the elements and gives you a place to live.</p>

                        <h1>Education for a child</h1>
                        <p>Education is a process of learning through which we acquire knowledge. It enlightens,
                            empowers,
                            and creates a positive development. Education gives an individual the knowledge and skills
                            to
                            work with virtue. It aids the all-round mental, physical, and intellectual growth and
                            development of an individual.</p>
